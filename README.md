# Insurgency Coop Theaters

This repository contains theater files that I either created or modified from an existing theater that modifies the gameplay of Insurgency. I will only store theaters that are designed for coop gamemodes such as Checkpoint, Hunt, and Survival.

PISTBOT
--------
Modified version of ZOMBOT where bots now have Makarovs instead of just knives. Players now have more ammo and can also carry a Mossberg shotgun as a primary weapon instead of just a Mosin Nagant. 

PISTBOT_AUTO
------------
Same as PISTBOT except that bots have automatic firing makarovs.

rambo
------
Players can only have an M249 without any attachments. Players cannot reload M249s but it contains 2000 rounds of bullets to use. Insurgent loadouts are default coop loadouts.

rambo_recoiless
---------------
Same as rambo except that M249 have 0 recoil.
