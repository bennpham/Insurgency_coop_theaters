# Insurgency Coop Theaters

This repository contains theater files that I either created or modified from an existing theater that modifies the gameplay of Insurgency. I will only store theaters that are designed for coop gamemodes such as Checkpoint, Hunt, and Survival.

PISTBOT
--------
Mosin Nagant, Shotgun, Secondary (auto m9, shotgun). Bots uses Makarov against you. They won't fire if you're too far. Modified version of ZOMBOT. 

PISTBOT_AUTO
------------
Same as PISTBOT except that bots have automatic firing makarovs.

rambo
------
Players can only have an M249 without any attachments. Players cannot reload M249s but it contains 2000 rounds of bullets to use. Insurgent loadouts are default coop loadouts.

rambo_recoiless
---------------
Same as rambo except that M249 have 0 recoil.
